# Technical Test Rock Paper Scissors
## Yeray Molina Garc√≠a

## Introduction

- This technical test consists of the development of the rock, paper or scissors game. For the game, a front application has been created where the user can create a user, login with said user, play the game and see their statistics.

## Which third party libraries, frameworks and components have been used

- Frontend:
To make the frontend application I have used Angular v15, Angular Material for the creation of the user interface and ngx-charts to add the charts of the statistics.

- Backend:
For the construction of the backend I have used the Spring framework that provides me with all the necessary tools to build a backend quickly and easily.
